- Alternative translations for ambiguous terms
- Terminology decisions

## Special Handling

- **Technical terms**: Keep universally recognized terms (API, CPU)
- **Proper nouns**: Keep personal names in original
- **Brand names**: Preserve as-is

Ask for clarification on ambiguous terms rather than guessing.
